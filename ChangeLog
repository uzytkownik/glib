        * configure.in:
	Final fixes for struct statfs.f_fstypename checks (OpenBSD). (#521045)
	Patch from ephraim_owns@hotmail.com

2008-03-19  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	Bug 523298 - win_iconv can't convert from UTF-8 to GB18030 (or vice versa)

	* glib/win_iconv.c: Fixes for code page 54936 (GB18030)
	(mbtowc_flags): New function. Check if a code page is one of those
	for which the dwFlags parameter to MultiByteToWideChar() must be
	zero. Return 0 or MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS.
	(mbcs_mblen): New function for multi-byte (more than two bytes for
	some characters) code pages. Only handles 54936 for now.
	(make_csconv): Use it for 54936.
	(kernel_mbtowc): Use mbtowc_flags().

	Bug 522292 - Gives warnings in glib/gutils.h with GCC in C99 mode

	* glib/gutils.h: Use "__attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__))" for inlining
	if either __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__ or __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ are defined. In
	gcc version prior to 4.3 no correct C99-inline was implemented which
	has semantic differences to GNU inline.

	* configure.in: Don't bother defining Autoconf variables for
	glib.def, gmodule.def, gobject.def and gthread.def when this can
	be handled easily in */Makefile.am which are the only files that
	use them. Remove also TESTGMODULE_EXP which isn't used at all.

	* glib/Makefile.am: Corrsponding change.

	* glib/*.h: make it possible to disable single-file includes by
	defining G_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES when building against GLib.
	Approved by Tim Janik.

	* glib/glib.h: include <glib/gslice.h>.

	* glib/gi18n.h
	* glib/gi18n-lib.h
	* glib/gprintf.h: include <glib.h> so the above works when these
	files are included without including <glib.h> first.

        * configure.in:
	Add required includes for f_fstypename member check.

2008-03-14  Alexander Larsson  <alexl@redhat.com>

2008-03-12  Matthias Clasen <mclasen@redhat.com>
