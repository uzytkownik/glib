	* glib/gmappedfile.c (g_mapped_file_new): Report an error
	if the file is too large.  (#315275, Kjartan Maraas)

	* glib/gkeyfile.c (g_key_file_load_from_fd): The return value
	of read() is signed.  (#315273, Kjartan Maraas)

	* glib/gutils.h: Wrapping atexit() is a bad idea on Windows, where
	the EXE and each DLL have their own atexit function chains.

	#define g_atexit as atexit instead. This means it has a
	better chance of doing what the caller wants. For instance,
	gtkhtml calls g_atexit() registering a function in gtkhtml
	itself. This caused a crash when g_atexit() was implemented as a
	function in the GLib DLL. The gtkhtml DLL was already unloaded by
	the time the GLib DLL got unloaded.

	* glib/gutils.c: #undef the #define mentioned above, to also get a
	real g_atexit() into the DLL for backward compatibility. Document
	the Windows behaviour of g_atexit(), and document the varying ways
	atexit() can behave in the context of dynamically loaded modules
	on Unix.

	* glib/glib.symbols: 
	* glib/gquark.h: 
	* glib/gdataset.c: Add string interning functions.

	* glib/giochannel.c: Unify some near-duplicate strings. (#314654,
	Clytie Siddall)

	* configure.in: Bump version to 2.9.0

2005-08-25  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	Make also the g_spawn*() functions take parameters in the GLib
	file name encoding, i.e. UTF-8, on Windows. Has no impact on Unix
	API or ABI. Like the other GLib API that was earlier changed to
	use UTF-8 on Windows, the names of the functions that take UTF-8
	have _utf8 suffixes added by using preprocessor macros in the
	header file. The old names are kept for functions with the old
	behaviour, taking parameters in the system codepage, for DLL ABI
	stability.
	
	* glib/gspawn.h: On Win32 add the suffix _utf8 to the names of the
	g_spawn*() functions.
	
	* glib/gspawn-win32.c: Use wide-char API on NT-based
	Windows. Convert parameters from UTF-8 to wide chars (NT) or
	system codepage (Win9x) and call the C library _wspawn*() or
	spawn*() functions respectvely. Add DLL ABI stability versions
	that take parameters in the system codepage.

	* glib/gspawn-win32-helper.c: On NT-based Windows use the
	wide-char versions of argv and envp, and use wide-char API to
	change directory and spawn the program to run. Remove the verbose
	debugging output, it was too complex to modify for the wide-char
	features. (Just add temporary debugging printouts if needed, no
	need to have them permanently in the source.)

	* glib/gspawn.c: Corresponding documentation updates.

	* glib/glib.symbols: Corresponding changes: Mark the ABI stability
	symbols as PRIVATE, add the new _utf8-suffixed ones.

	* glib/gtypes.h (G_MININT64): Cast the constant to gint64; it is
	guint64 otherwise and that can produce warnings about comparison
	between signed and unsigned.

2005-08-23  Matthias Clasen  <mclasen@redhat.com>

	* glib/gutils.c: Fix the crt_externs.h include.

	* configure.in: Check for crt_externs.h and _NSGetEnviron.

	* glib/gutils.c: On Darwin, include crt-externs.h and
	define environ using _NSGetEnviron().  (#313731)

2005-08-16  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* glib/gutils.c (g_get_any_init): Move the body of the big if...
	(g_get_any_init_do): ... to this new function.
	(g_get_any_init): Declare as inline.
	(g_get_any_init_locked): New inline function, does the locking.
	Make use of these two throughout the code.

2005-08-15  Matthias Clasen  <mclasen@redhat.com>

	* glib/gbacktrace.c (g_on_error_stack_trace): Wait for
	the child process and then simply return. This makes 
	The "S" option work as documented in g_on_error_query().
	(#313125, Matthew F. Barnes)

	* glib/gunicode.h: Update the link to Unicode category
	values.  (#313369, Behnam Esfahbod)

	* glib/gqueue.c (g_queue_find_custom): Clarify docs
	a little.  (#311727, Tristan van Berkom)

	* glib/abicheck.sh, gobject/abicheck.sh: Make the 
	check work on ia64 too, where some symbols ended up 
	in yet another section.
