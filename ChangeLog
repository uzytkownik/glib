	* configure.in: Don't bother defining Autoconf variables for
	glib.def, gmodule.def, gobject.def and gthread.def when this can
	be handled easily in */Makefile.am which are the only files that
	use them. Remove also TESTGMODULE_EXP which isn't used at all.

	* glib/Makefile.am: Corrsponding change.

	* glib/*.h: make it possible to disable single-file includes by
	defining G_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES when building against GLib.
	Approved by Tim Janik.

	* glib/glib.h: include <glib/gslice.h>.

	* glib/gi18n.h
	* glib/gi18n-lib.h
	* glib/gprintf.h: include <glib.h> so the above works when these
	files are included without including <glib.h> first.
