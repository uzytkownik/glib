For more information about the Windows port, see
http://www.iki.fi/tml/gimp/win32/ .

As for now, only Microsoft C is really supported. Before compiling,
check the BIN definition in makefile.msc. Compile with `nmake -f
makefile.msc`. Install with `nmake -f makefile.msc install`. Gnu-Win32
with egcs and maybe LCC-Win32 support will be added later.
