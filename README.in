General Information
===================

This is GLib version @GLIB_VERSION@. GLib is the low-level core
library that forms the basis for projects such as GTK+ and GNOME. It
provides data structure handling for C, portability wrappers, and
interfaces for such runtime functionality as an event loop, threads,
dynamic loading, and an object system.

Installation
============

See the file 'INSTALL'

Notes about GLib-2.0.0
======================

* On systems without the libintl from GNU gettext() or a recent version
  of the GNU C library, the encoding of translated error messages will be 
  incorrect (they should be in UTF-8). A workaround for this is to install 
  GNU gettext and use that libintl. This is expected to be fixed in GLib-2.0.1.
  Application programmers should not call g_locale_to_utf8() on these
  strings.

* The results of g_strerror() are currently in the encoding of the locale
  rather than in UTF-8. Again, this is a bug, and not behavior that
  should be relied upon.

* Similarly, the GLib error logging functions such as g_print(), g_warning(),
  g_error(), currently do not convert the strings they are passed from
  UTF-8 to the encoding of the locale, or check that the strings they
  are passed are valid UTF-8. They should, despite this, be assumed to take
  UTF-8 arguments.


How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system. 
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product glib.) You will need
to create an account for yourself.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with the testgtk program that is built 
  in the gtk/ subdirectory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, 
  please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. 
  As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece 
  of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out
  when the crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but
  is not necessary.

Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the
patch fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment
to that bug report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch,
and attach the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword
in their keyword fields. If the patch adds to or changes the GLib 
programming interface, the API keyword should also be included.

Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU
diff.)
