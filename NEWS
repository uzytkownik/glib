* Added safe/portable temporary file manipulation functions.  [Tor]
* autoconf improvements.  [Raja]
* Many documentation improvements.
* Bug fixes.

* Double ended queue implementation.
* GLib macros for printf() formatting, e.g. G_GULONG_FORMAT = "lu"
* New configure option --enable-msg-prefix to prefix messages, warnings
  et ceteri with the program name and the process id.
* New thread-safe random number generator Mersenne Twister.
* g_strcompress() added, g_strescape() had a slight API change, and
