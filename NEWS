Overview of Changes in GLib 1.1.3:

* New library gmodule included which basically wraps dlopen() facilities.
* New g_log() mechanism for logging of messages at different log levels,
  associated with certain log domains (define -DG_LOG_DOMAIN for your module).
* New inline functions for bit masks tests.
* GNode functions now return the newly allocated node.
* New macro G_VA_COPY() to work around va_list copying oddities on some
  platforms. the non-static g_vsprintf() function vanished in favour of
  a publically exported g_strdup_vprintf().
* New utility functions for string and printf-like format handling .
* Lotsa bug fixes and cleanups as always ;)

Overview of Changes in GLib 1.1.2:

* Fixed packaging mistake which occured in 1.1.1
* fix 64-bitness in g_prints in glibtest

What is new in GLib 1.1.1:

* An n-way tree implementation is provided now, based on the GNode structure.
* Bugfix for pointer arrays.

What is new in GLib 1.1.0:

* GLib is distributed seperatedly from Gtk+ now and uses a sophisticated
  shared library versioning scheme to deal with interface and binary
  incompatibilities.
* There is a glib-config helper script installed now.
* Fixups all over the place.
* gboolean is now a gint, not a gchar anymore.
* API extensions for GList and GSList.
* New g_str*() functions for simple string handling.
* GScanner extensions for scope, warning and error handling.
* Minor performance improvements for GMemChunks.
* Implementations of GQuarks and datasets (similar to GtkObjects data
  mechansim, but works for generic memory locations).
* More convenience macros for GNU C function arguments.
* Const correction all over the place, including a new pointer type
  gconstpointer.
* Generic functions for TAB completions.
* GRelations for n-way mapping of certain data.
