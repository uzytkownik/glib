Overview of Changes in GLib 1.1.3:

* New GModule mechanism (implemented in an extra library) which wraps dynamic
  object code loading facilities in a portable manner.
* glib-config features extra "glib" (old behaviour remains) and "gmodule"
  (add libgmodule.so to the --libs output) arguments now. this can also
  be specified as fourth argument to the AM_PATH_GLIB() macro.
* Overhaul of the `inline' autoconfiguration stuff, so inlining should be
  sufficiently supported on all systems that allow inlining now.
* New g_log() mechanism for logging of messages at different log levels,
  associated with certain log domains (define -DG_LOG_DOMAIN for your library).
* New inline functions for bit masks tests.
* GNode macros (and functions) now return the newly allocated node.
* New macro G_VA_COPY() to work around va_list copying oddities on some
  platforms. the non-static g_vsprintf() function vanished in favour of
  a publically exported g_strdup_vprintf().
  People that used the former g_vsprintf() would definitely want to read the
  associated ChangeLog entries (grep for printf).
* New utility functions:
  g_strndup(), g_on_error_query(), g_on_error_stack_trace(), g_strdup_printf(),
  g_strdup_vprintf(), g_printf_string_upper_bound(), g_spaced_primes_closest(),
  g_strnfill(), g_memdup(). 
* Overhaul of the array implementations, this contains some source incompatible
  changes. Again, the ChangeLog is much more informative (grep for garray.c).
* The internals of the g_dataset mechanism are now exported through the
  new g_datalist_* API (this is also the underlying implementation for the
  keyed data of GtkObjects).
* New function g_atexit(), use of the ATEXIT() macro is discouraged.
* Better configure checks for ansi compliance.
* Libtool update to version 1.2b.
* Lotsa bug fixes and cleanups as always ;)

Overview of Changes in GLib 1.1.2:

* Fixed packaging mistake which occured in 1.1.1
* fix 64-bitness in g_prints in glibtest

What is new in GLib 1.1.1:

* An n-way tree implementation is provided now, based on the GNode structure.
* Bugfix for pointer arrays.

What is new in GLib 1.1.0:

* GLib is distributed seperatedly from Gtk+ now and uses a sophisticated
  shared library versioning scheme to deal with interface and binary
  incompatibilities.
* There is a glib-config helper script installed now.
* Fixups all over the place.
* gboolean is now a gint, not a gchar anymore.
* API extensions for GList and GSList.
* New g_str*() functions for simple string handling.
* GScanner extensions for scope, warning and error handling.
* Minor performance improvements for GMemChunks.
* Implementations of GQuarks and datasets (similar to GtkObjects data
  mechansim, but works for generic memory locations).
* More convenience macros for GNU C function arguments.
* Const correction all over the place, including a new pointer type
  gconstpointer.
* Generic functions for TAB completions.
* GRelations for n-way mapping of certain data.
