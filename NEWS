What is new in GLib 1.1.0:

* GLib is distributed seperatedly from Gtk+ now and uses a sophisticated
  shared library versioning scheme to deal with interface and binary
  incompatibilities.
* There is a glib-config helper script installed now.
* Fixups all over the place.
* gboolean is now a gint, not a gchar anymore.
* API extensions for GList and GSList.
* New g_str*() functions for simple string handling.
* GScanner extensions for scope, warning and error handling.
* Minor performance improvements for GMemChunks.
* Implementations of GQuarks and datasets (similar to GtkObjects data
  mechansim, but works for generic memory locations).
* More convenience macros for GNU C function arguments.
* Const correction all over the place, including a new pointer type
  gconstpointer.
* Generic functions for TAB completions.
* GRelations for n-way mapping of certain data.
