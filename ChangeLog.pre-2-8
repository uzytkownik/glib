1999-03-14  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (glibconfig.h): Remove widechar tests and defines.
	(fd_set): Change the grep for `fd_mask' to search for `fd_set'.
	* gerror.c (fd_mask): Remove conditional typedef.  It is not used
	elsewhere in the file.
	* gmain.c (fd_mask): Likewise.

1999-03-12  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* configure.in: Test for posix threads first, then for dce threads.

1999-03-11  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* configure.in: Revamped the thread configure stuff. Now dce
	threads (old posix draft) are recogniced. This is necessary,
	because dce threads are in fact working quite differently from
	posix threads. Also changed the conditions for checking for MT
	safe functions a bit, because G_THREADS_IMPL_NONE still have to
	compile thread safe. NOTE: Please do not commit my change to
	glib-1-2/{acconfig.h,configure.in,config.h.win32} from 1999-03-03,
	as the current change will take care of that too.

Tue Mar  9 14:37:32 1999  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am, glib.h, gstack.c, gqueue.c,
	  tests/Makefile.am, tests/queue-test.c, tests/stack-test.c:
	Added stack, queue ADTs and related tests.

	* glib.h, glist.c:
	New g_list_delete() function.

Sat Mar  6 11:03:08 1999  Asbjorn Pettersen  <ape@lrdpf.spacetec.no>

	* gutils.c (g_get_any_init): add OS/2 changes.
	change '\\' in HOME to '/'.

1999-03-03  Josh MacDonald  <jmacd@spin.dsl.pacbell.net>

	* glib.def: g_spaced_primes_closest was omitted here, so I
	couldn't build Xdelta on Windows.

1999-03-01  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* gutils.c (g_get_any_init): Fixed yet another bloody
	implementation of getpwuid_r on AIX. Thanks to Olaf Dietsche
	<olaf.dietsche+list.gtk@netcologne.de>. I would like a configure
	test better than that, but have no idea, how to do that easily.

Sat Feb 27 01:18:47 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* ChangeLog: moved old ChangeLog to ChangeLog.pre-1-2, and started
	new one.

	* configure.in: set glib version to 1.3.0.
