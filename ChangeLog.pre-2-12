	* gutils.c (g_get_any_init): Fixed yet another bloody
	implementation of getpwuid_r on AIX. Thanks to Olaf Dietsche
	<olaf.dietsche+list.gtk@netcologne.de>. I would like a configure
	test better than that, but have no idea, how to do that easily.

	* ChangeLog: moved old ChangeLog to ChangeLog.pre-1-2, and started
	new one.
	
	* configure.in: set glib version to 1.3.0.
