	* glib/gthreadpool.c: Updated the documentation to explain that
	when the maximum threads is > 1 the sort functionality is not 100%
	accurate due to the ramdom nature of the scheduler choosing which
	threads to execute. Fixes bug #334943.

	* tests/threadpool-test.c: Disabled the debugging by default and
	fixed the sort test to set the maximum threads to 1 to guarantee
	the thread entry function is called in order.
