	<p>
          glib has a GDate class for calendrical calculations, but also needs a
          way to deal with time. Fairly tricky to implement well.

      <description>
	<p>
          Someone (happybob?) wrote regexp support for glib. This needs to get a
          final audit and then go in to the source tree.

      <title>Argument parsing</title>
      <description>
	<p>
          Put support for command line argument parsing in glib. 
          This should probably just be a renaming of popt. 
          It's a larger task if you start from scratch.
