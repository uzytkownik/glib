<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
The Main Event Loop

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
manages all available sources of events.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
The main event loop manages all the available sources of events for GLib
and GTK+ applications. These events can come from any number of different
types of sources such as file descriptors (plain files, pipes or sockets)
and timeouts.
New types of event sources can also be added using g_source_add().
</para>
<para>
Each event source is assigned a priority.
The default priority, #G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, is 0.
Values less than 0 denote higher priorities.
Values greater than 0 denote lower priorities.
Events from high priority sources
are always processed before events from lower priority sources.
</para>
<para>
Idle functions can also be added, and assigned a priority. These will be
run whenever no events with a higher priority are ready to be processed.
</para>
<para>
The #GMainLoop data type represents a main event loop.
A #GMainLoop is created with g_main_new(). After adding the initial event
sources, g_main_run() is called. This continuously checks for new events
from each of the event sources and dispatches them.
Finally, the processing of an event from one of the sources leads to a call
to g_main_quit() to exit the main loop, and g_main_run() returns.
</para>
<para>
It is possible to create new instances of #GMainLoop recursively.
This is often used in GTK+ applications when showing modal dialog boxes.
However, all event sources are global; they are not tied to a particular
#GMainLoop.
</para>
<para>
GTK+ contains wrappers of many of these functions,
e.g. gtk_main(), gtk_main_quit(), gtk_events_pending(), gtk_idle_add(),
gtk_timeout_add() and gtk_input_add_full().
In a GTK+ application, these wrapper functions should be used instead.
</para>

<!-- ##### STRUCT GMainLoop ##### -->
<para>
The #GMainLoop struct is an opaque data type representing the main event loop
of a GLib or GTK+ application.
</para>


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_main_new ##### -->
<para>
Creates a new #GMainLoop.
</para>

@is_running: set to TRUE to indicate that the loop is running. This is not
very important since calling g_main_run() will set this to TRUE anyway.
@Returns: a new #GMainLoop.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_main_destroy ##### -->
<para>
Frees the memory allocated for the #GMainLoop.
</para>

@loop: a #GMainLoop.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_main_run ##### -->
<para>
Runs a main loop until it stops running, which occurs when g_main_quit()
is called.
</para>

@loop: a #GMainLoop.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_main_is_running ##### -->
<para>
Returns TRUE if the main loop is running.
</para>

@loop: a #GMainLoop.
@Returns: TRUE if the main loop is running.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_main_pending ##### -->
<para>
Returns TRUE if any events are pending (i.e. ready to be processed).
</para>

@Returns: TRUE if any events are pending.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_main_iteration ##### -->
<para>
Runs a single iteration of the main loop.
This will check which event sources are ready to be processed, and will
process the highest priority event sources which are ready.
</para>

@may_block: set to TRUE if it should block (i.e. wait) until an event source
becomes ready. It will return after an event source has been processed.
If set to FALSE it will return immediately if no event source is ready to be
processed.
@Returns: TRUE if more events are pending.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_main_quit ##### -->
<para>
Stops the #GMainLoop. If g_main_run() was called to run the #GMainLoop,
it will now return.
</para>

@loop: a #GMainLoop.


<!-- ##### MACRO G_PRIORITY_HIGH ##### -->
<para>
Use this for high priority event sources.
It is not used within GLib or GTK+.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT ##### -->
<para>
Use this for default priority event sources.
In GLib this priority is used when adding timeout functions with
g_timeout_add().
In GDK this priority is used for events from the X Windows server.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE ##### -->
<para>
Use this for high priority idle functions.
GTK+ uses #G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE + 10 for resizing operations, and
#G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE + 20 for redrawing operations. (This is done to
ensure that any pending resizes are processed before any pending redraws,
so that widgets are not redrawn twice unnecessarily.)
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE ##### -->
<para>
Use this for default priority idle functions.
In GLib this priority is used when adding idle functions with g_idle_add().
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO G_PRIORITY_LOW ##### -->
<para>
Use this for very low priority background tasks.
It is not used within GLib or GTK+.
</para>



<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_timeout_add ##### -->
<para>
Sets a function to be called at regular intervals, with the default priority,
#G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT.
The function is called repeatedly until it returns FALSE, at which point
the timeout is automatically destroyed and the function will not be called
again.
The first call to the function will be at the end of the first @interval.
</para>
<para>
Note that timeout functions may be delayed, due to the processing of other
event sources. Thus they should not be relied on for precise timing.
After each call to the timeout function, the time of the next
timeout is recalculated based on the current time and the given interval
(it does not try to 'catch up' time lost in delays).
</para>

@interval: the time between calls to @function, in milliseconds (1/1000ths
of a second.)
@function: the function to call at each interval.
@data: data to pass to @function.
@Returns: the id of the event source.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_timeout_add_full ##### -->
<para>
Sets a function to be called at regular intervals, with the given priority.
The function is called repeatedly until it returns FALSE, at which point
the timeout is automatically destroyed and the function will not be called
again.
The @notify function is called when the timeout is destroyed.
The first call to the function will be at the end of the first @interval.
</para>

<!-- ##### USER_FUNCTION GSourceFunc ##### -->
<para>
Specifies the type of function passed to g_timeout_add(), g_timeout_add_full(),
g_idle_add(), and g_idle_add_full().
</para>

@data: data passed to the function, set when the source was created with one
of the above functions.
@Returns: it should return FALSE if the source should be removed.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_idle_add ##### -->
<para>
Adds a function to be called whenever there are no higher priority events
pending. The function is given the default idle priority,
#G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE.
If the function returns FALSE it is automatically removed from the list of
event sources and will not be called again.
</para>

@function: the function to call.
@data: data to pass to the function.
@Returns: the id of the event source.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_idle_add_full ##### -->
<para>
Adds a function to be called whenever there are no higher priority events
pending.
If the function returns FALSE it is automatically removed from the list of
event sources and will not be called again.
</para>

@priority: the priority of the idle function, which should be somewhere around
#G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE and #G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE.
@function: the function to call.
@data: data to pass to the function.
@destroy: the function to call when the timeout is destroyed, or NULL.
@Returns: the id of the event source.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_idle_remove_by_data ##### -->
<para>
Removes the idle function with the given data.
</para>

@data: the data which is passed to the idle function.
@Returns: TRUE if the idle function was found.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_main_add_poll ##### -->
<para>
Adds a file descriptor to be polled.
This is usually combined with g_source_add() to add an event source.
The event source's check function will typically test the revents
field in the #GPollFD struct and return TRUE if events need to be processed.
</para>

@fd: a #GPollFD, which is a file descriptor together with a bitwise
combination of #GIOCondition flags determining which events to poll for.
@priority: the priority of the poll, which should be the same as the priority
used for g_source_add() to ensure that the file descriptor is polled whenever
the results may be needed.
See #G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, #G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE, #G_PRIORITY_HIGH,
#G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE, and #G_PRIORITY_LOW.

<!-- ##### STRUCT GSourceFuncs ##### -->
<para>
The #GSourceFuncs struct contains a table of functions used to handle
event sources in a generic manner.

<informaltable pgwide=1 frame="none" role="struct">
<tgroup cols="2"><colspec colwidth="2*"><colspec colwidth="8*">
<tbody>

<row>
<entry>prepare</entry>
<entry>
Called before all the file descriptors are polled.
If the source can determine that it is ready here (without waiting for the
results of the poll() call) it should return TRUE.
It can also return a @timeout value which should be the maximum timeout
(in milliseconds) which should be passed to the poll() call.
The actual timeout used will be -1 if all sources returned -1, or it will
be the minimum of all the @timeout values returned which were >= 0.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>check</entry>
<entry>
Called after all the file descriptors are polled.
The source should return TRUE if it is ready to be processed.
Note that some time may have passed since the previous prepare function was
called, so the source should be checked again here.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>dispatch</entry>
<entry>
Called to process the event source, after it has returned TRUE in either
its @prepare or its @check function.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>destroy</entry>
<entry>

parameter passed to the g_source_add() and related functions.
</entry>
</row>
</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>
</para>

<para>
For idle sources, the prepare and check functions always return TRUE to
indicate that the source is always ready to be processed.
The prepare function also returns a timeout value of 0 to ensure that the
poll() call doesn't block (since that would be time wasted which could have
been spent running the idle function).
</para>
<para>
For timeout sources, the prepare and check functions both return TRUE if the
timeout interval has expired.
The prepare function also returns a timeout value to ensure that the poll()
call doesn't block too long and miss the next timeout.
</para>
<para>
For file descriptor sources, the prepare function typically returns FALSE,
since it must wait until poll() has been called before it knows whether any
events need to be processed. It sets the returned timeout to -1 to indicate
that it doesn't mind how long the poll() call blocks.
In the check function, it tests the results of the poll() call to see if
the required condition has been met, and returns TRUE if so.
