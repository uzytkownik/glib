/* The various request possibilities:
 *
 * 1. Synchronous: handed off to the base class (GThreadedResolver);
 *    since it's never possible to cancel a synchronous request in a
 *    single-threaded program, the request is done in the calling
 *    thread.
 *
 * 2. Asynchronous: An appropriate _g_asyncns_query_t is created, and
 *    then a GUnixResolverRequest is created with that query and a
 *    GSimpleAsyncResult. Two sub-possibilities:
 *
 *      a. The resolution completes: g_unix_resolver_watch() sees that
 *         the request has completed, and calls
 *         g_unix_resolver_request_complete(), which detaches the
 *         "cancelled" signal handler (if it was present) and then
 *         immediately completes the async_result (since
 *         g_unix_resolver_watch() is already run from main-loop
 *         time.) After completing the async_result, it unrefs it,
 *         causing the req to be freed as well.
 *
 *      b. The resolution is cancelled: request_cancelled() calls
 *         _g_asyncns_cancel() to cancel the resolution. Then it calls
 *         g_unix_resolver_request_complete(), which detaches the
 *         signal handler, and queues async_result to complete in an
 *         idle handler. It then unrefs the async_result to ensure
 *         that after its callback runs, it will be destroyed, in turn
 *         causing the req to be freed. Because the asyncns resolution
 *         was cancelled, g_unix_resolver_watch() will never be
 *         triggered for this req.
 *
 *    Since there's only a single thread, it's not possible for the
 *    request to both complete and be cancelled "at the same time",
 *    and each of the two possibilities takes steps to block the other
 *    from being able to happen later, so it's always safe to free req
 *    after the async_result completes.
