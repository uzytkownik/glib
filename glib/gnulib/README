The files
 
 asnprintf.c 
 printf-args.c
 printf-args.h
 printf-parse.c
 printf-parse.h
 vasnprintf.c
 vasnprintf.h

are taken from the vasnprintf module of the GNUlib package, which can
be found at: 

 http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/

They have been modified to include g-gnulib.h. vasnprintf.c has also been modified to 
include support for long long printing if the system printf doesn't. This code is protected
by #ifndef HAVE_LON_LONG_FORMAT.
 
The files 

 printf.h 
 printf.c
 g-gnulib.h

have been written by me. printf.[hc] contain implementations of the
remaining functions in the printf family based on
vasnprintf. g-gnulib.h is included by all source files in order to
move all exported functions to the _g_gnulib namespace, replace malloc
by g_malloc and make sure that snprintf is only used if it implements
C99 return value semantics.
