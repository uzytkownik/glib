1999-06-17  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* gthread-posix.c, gthread-solaris.c: Added the native
	implementations for the GLib's extended thread support.

	* gthread-nspr.c: Removed for good. NSPR is nothing we would want
	to build upon.

	* gthread.c: Renamed to gthread-impl.c to avoid confusion with
	../gthread.c (Formerly known as the file called gmutex.c)

	* testgthread.c: Removed. The new and much extended tests are in
	../tests/thread-test.c.

	* Makefile.am: Changed to reflect the changes above.

1999-03-31  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* gthread-posix.c: Use the right default arguments for the
	construction of mutexes and conds for dce threads, these are
	&pthread_(cond|mutex)attr_default instead of NULL. Hint from
	D. Emilio Grimaldo Tunon <emilio_tunon@nl.compuware.com>.

1999-03-18  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added @GTHREAD_COMPILE_IMPL_DEFINES@.

1999-03-12  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* gthread-posix.c (g_private_get_posix_impl): Fixed typo for DCE
	implementation.

1999-03-11  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* gthread-posix.c: Now handle both dce and posix threads. They are
	sufficently equal. Please do not commit my change to
	glib-1-2/gthread/gthread-posix.c from 1999-03-03, as the current
	change will take care of that too.

1999-02-15  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* testgthread.c (test_mutexes): Use new signature of
	g_static_mutex* functions.

1999-02-08  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* gthread-posix.c (g_private_get_posix_impl): Use the
	HAVE_PTHREAD_GETSPECIFIC_POSIX macro to determine, which signature
	to use for pthread_getspecific.

Tue Jan 19 20:56:02 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added gthread.def.

Sun Jan 17 10:58:19 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* gthread.def: New file.

1999-01-16 1999  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* gthread-posix.c: Conditionalize <sys/time.h> inclusion.

1999-01-07  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* testgthread.c: conditionally compile according to the
	G_THREADS_IMPL_??? macros.
	(test_private_func): use rand_r instead of rand to make it
	thread safe.

1998-12-18  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* testgthread.c (new_thread): As a joinable thread seems to be the
	default on posix, leave the explicit setting out, as it causes
	problems on some older platforms.

Wed Dec 16 22:21:33 CST 1998 Shawn T. Amundson <amundson@gtk.org>

	* gthread-posix.c: use g_free in mutex_free (from Tim Janik)

Thu Dec 17 03:38:57 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* Makefile.am: -DG_LOG_DOMAIN="GThread", we don't need an extern
	variable for that (noticed by Joel Becker <jlbec@ocala.cs.miami.edu>)

Wed Dec 16 03:16:16 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* testgthread.c: s/g_thread_supported/g_thread_supported ()/
	* gthread.c: s/g_thread_supported/g_threads_got_initialized/
	(g_thread_init): bail out if G_THREADS_ENABLED is not defined.

1998-12-15  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): updated.

	* testgthread.c, gthread-*.c: Changed private to private_key to
	avoid problems when compiling with under C++.

	* gthread-none.c: 
	s/g_mutex_functions_for_glib_use/g_thread_functions_for_glib_use/

	* ChangeLog: from now on there is an extra ChangeLog for gthread
